# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-on-Geolocational-Data

This project involves the use of K-Means Clustering to find the best accommodation for students in Bangalore by classifying accommodation for incoming students on the basis of their preferences on amenities, budget and proximity to the location.
Managers of restaurant and hotels can also leverage this information. For example, if a manager of a restaurant already knows the demographic of his current customers, theyâ€™d ideally want to open at a location where this demographic is at its highest concentration, ensuring short commute times to the location and more customers served.If potential hotel locations are being evaluated, a site that caters to a wide variety of tastes would be ideal, since one would want every guest to have something to their liking.
